2.  Define entry and exit points using technical indicators.
3.  Monitor market conditions, news releases, and other factors that may
    impact price movements.

### Breakout Strategy {#"breakout-strategy"}

resistance and profiting from price movements when these levels are
breached. Traders aim to enter trades at the early stages of a breakout,
hoping to ride the subsequent momentum.

    tools.
2.  Confirm breakout signals by waiting for the price to convincingly
    break through the identified levels.

before reversing.

    trendlines.
2.  Wait for pullbacks against the current trend to enter trades.
